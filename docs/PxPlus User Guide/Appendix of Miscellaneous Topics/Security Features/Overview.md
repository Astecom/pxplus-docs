Most operating systems allow different users to have access to the same machine, each with their own files, desktop settings, etc. Business applications are often designed so that multiple users can be logged onto the same system to access the same data over various types of networks and/or the Internet.

Of course, with multi-user capabilities come issues of security. Operating systems and networks provide their own level of protection, but ultimately, it is the developer who is responsible for securing sensitive data and for managing all the activities that are to be carried out within his/her applications.

PxPlus security measures can include various combinations of encryption, authentication, authorization, and access control functionality.

This Help section explains the various network-level, program-level, and data security features available to you when designing and building your applications.
