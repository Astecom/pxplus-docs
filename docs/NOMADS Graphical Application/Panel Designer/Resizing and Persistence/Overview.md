# Panel Designer  
  
**Resizing and Persistence** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
You can set up your graphical user interface application so that users have control over the size and location of your panel objects at run time.

_Resizing_ functionality in NOMADS allows a variety of resizing attributes to be set on different types of objects.

_Persistence_ functionality in NOMADS remembers the size/position of objects so that when the user closes a panel, the same coordinates are preserved the next time it is opened.

#### **Note:**  
Because the operation of this functionality is dependent on the types of objects used and where/how they are laid out on a panel, it is important that you test your panel in different situations to ensure that results are what you intended.
