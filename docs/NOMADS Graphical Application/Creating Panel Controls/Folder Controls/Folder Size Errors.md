A Folder that is too small to contain the controls for a panel will produce messages similar to the following:

> This is a common problem that occurs when placing panels in a folder control. If a folder is not large enough to contain the panels for which it is designed, NOMADS will complain when attempting to draw a control outside of the folder boundaries. The resulting warning messages detail the offending control's name, position, and size coordinates.

To correct this problem, you must reduce the size of the sub-panel or increase the size of the entire folder object.

1. |  Position the mouse pointer anywhere inside the folder. Click once then immediately hold down the left mouse button, and drag to increase/decrease the object's dimensions. See **[Modifying Objects](../../Panel%20Designer/Drawing%20and%20Modifying%20Panel%20Objects/Modifying%20Objects.md)** for information about other options for moving/resizing controls.

2. |  Resize the folder until it fills the entire panel. (Simply drag beyond the borders of the panel - the control will snap back until it is only as large as the panel itself.) You can also do this by changing the folder's _Size_ selections on the **Tabs/Folder Properties** dialogue for the Folder control.
