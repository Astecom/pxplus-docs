# System Parameters

**'W+'** |  **_Window Resize Tracking_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

The 'W+' parameter is used ** _internally_** by PxPlus to enable the automatic resizing of the main programmer Command window based on the size of the PxPlus window frame.

When 'W+' is set and the system sees a resize of the outer frame and you are at Command mode, the system internally calls the system **WDW** command.

_(The 'W+' system parameter and Command window resizing was added in PxPlus v9.00, build 9200.1.)_

##  Default

**_Off_**
