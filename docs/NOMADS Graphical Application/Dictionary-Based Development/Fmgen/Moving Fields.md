# Step 6: File Maintenance Field Layout

**Moving Fields**|   
---|---  
  
To move a **_single field_** to a target cell, use the drag and drop method. Fields cannot be multi-selected for moving.

Key fields **_always_** remain on the Main panel. They can be dragged and dropped to any cell on the Main panel but not to a cell on a folder panel.

If using the **[Enhanced Layout](Enhanced%20Layout.md)**, fields can be moved to a cell in the same row or in a different row. Another alternative is to use the **[Cut Cell / Paste Cell(s)](Enhanced%20Layout.htm#cut_paste)** options on the right click menu.

If using the **[Two-Column Layout](Two_column.md)**, fields can be moved to a row in the same column or in a different column. The **[Cut Cell / Paste Cell(s)](Two_column.htm#cut_paste)** right click menu options can also be used.

#### **Note:**  
Care should be taken when moving to a target cell that is not blank, as the contents being moved will overwrite the contents of the target cell **_except_** if the target cell contains a Key field. In that case, the Key field will not be overwritten and a message will display.  
  
If the target cell contains a data dictionary field, that field will be returned to the _Fields_ list box.  
  
If the target cell contains a horizontal line or fonted text, the line or text will be deleted.  
  
If the target cell contains a Smart List Box, Smart Chart, Image, Embedded Panel or HTML Short Codes, a message will display.
