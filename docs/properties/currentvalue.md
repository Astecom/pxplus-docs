**CurrentValue $** |  **_Value of Current Cell in Grid_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Value of current cell in grid

This property is used to access the value of the current cell within a grid. Using the CurrentValue$ property avoids the application from having to set the **['Row](row.md)** and **['Colno](colno.md)** properties for a grid prior to reading the value in the grid.

_(The CurrentValue$ property was added in PxPlus v8.11, build 9182.8.)_
