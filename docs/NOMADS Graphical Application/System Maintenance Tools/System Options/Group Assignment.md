The **[Group Assignment](../../NOMADS%20Development/Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Group%20Assignment.md)** utility is used to define groups to which **[Panel Controls](../../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Introduction.md)** can be assigned for the purpose of showing/hiding, disabling/enabling and locking/unlocking them collectively based on conditions specified using **[Dependency Definitions](../../Panel%20Designer/Options%20and%20Utilities/Dependency%20Definitions.md)** or the ***wingrp** utility. For information on the ***wingrp** utility, see **[Manipulating and Controlling Groups](../../Program%20Interaction/Event-Handler%20Routines/Manipulating%20and%20Controlling%20Groups.md)**.

To invoke the **Group Assignment** utility, select _Options_ > _Group Assignment_ from the **[NOMADS Session Manager](../../NOMADS%20Development/Getting%20Started.htm#sessionmgr)** menu bar.
