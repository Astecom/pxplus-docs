# Mnemonics

**'ZX'** |  **_Return Attributes as per BBx_**  
---|---  
  
**Behaviour**

##  Description

Use **'ZX'** to resolve inconsistency in the attributes format and the FIN values when you run PxPlus with code designed for BBx. (In prior versions, the attributes as returned when issuing a Terminal Read from Start, **['TR'](tr.md)**, in graphics mode had the foreground and background values reversed and an incorrect window scroll region position.)

If you print the **'ZX'** mnemonic, PxPlus reports the attributes and FIN values consistent with BBx.
