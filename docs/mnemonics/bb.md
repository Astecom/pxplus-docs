# Mnemonics 

**'BB'** |  **_Begin Blinking/Bold_**  
---|---  
  
**Character Display**

##  Description

When sent to a terminal device, the **'BB'** mnemonic causes the text to begin blinking. Use of this mnemonic is dependent on the capabilities of the terminal being used. When sent to printer using ***WINPRT*** or ***PDF*** output, the output will be **bold**.

To end blinking/bold mode, use the **'EB'** mnemonic.

#### **Note:**  
Blinking on graphical devices was added in PxPlus v8.11 (build 9182) and was not supported prior that release.
