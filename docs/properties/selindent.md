## Description

RTF word processor INDENTATION setting

This property reflects the Indentation to be used for the currently selected paragraph(s) in a RTF word processor multi-line style control. If no paragraph is currently selected, the current text entry will be affected. The Indentation is measured in TWIPS, which is 1/1440 of an inch (or 1/20th of a POINT). To create an indentation of 1/2 an inch, use 720.

_(The SelIndent property was added in PxPlus v7.10.)_
