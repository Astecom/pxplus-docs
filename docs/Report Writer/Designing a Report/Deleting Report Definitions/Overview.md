# Designing a Report

**Deleting Report Definitions** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Report definitions can be deleted by selecting the _Delete_ option from the Report Designer _File_ menu. A **Delete Report Definition** window with an input control is displayed. Enter the name of the report definition file to delete or use the query button provided to specify the file. Click the _Delete_ button, and a message will display prior to deleting.

On Windows-based systems, files can also be deleted from any file selection dialog.

To suppress the _Delete_ option, set the global variable **%RW_Suppress_Delete=1**.
