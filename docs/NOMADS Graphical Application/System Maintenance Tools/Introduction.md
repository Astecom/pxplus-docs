**Option/Utility** |  **Description**  
---|---  
**[Security Manager](Security%20Manager/Overview.md)** |  Optional security system that uses security classifications to identify and control user access and provides the option to set up **[Two-Factor Authentication](Security%20Manager/Overview.htm#tfa)** (TFA) for added security. _(The option to set up Two-Factor Authentication was added in PxPlus 2023.)_  
**[System Defaults](System%20Options/System%20Defaults.md)** |  Used for establishing a set of system defaults to be used as the common starting point for future graphical user interface designs.  
**[Message Library Maintenance](../Message%20Library%20Maintenance/Overview.md)** |  Used for setting up message libraries that can be accessed by various different graphical user interface applications.  
**[User Defined Colors](System%20Options/User%20Defined%20Colours.md)** |  Allows access to a 255-color palette to establish customized colors for reuse throughout your applications.  
**[Group Assignment](../NOMADS%20Development/Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Group%20Assignment.md)** |  Used for defining groups to which **[Panel Controls](../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Introduction.md)** can be assigned for the purpose of showing/hiding, disabling/enabling and locking/unlocking them collectively.  
**[Auto Complete](System%20Options/Auto%20Complete.md)** |  Enables **[Multi-Line](../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Multi-Line%20Control/Overview.md)** or **[Grid](../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Grid%20Control/Overview.md)** controls to show suggested text based on partially typed entries, which is useful for handling repetitive data entry.  
**[Themes](System%20Options/Themes.md)** |  Used for defining a set of display properties for **_all controls_** based on the control type (i.e. all "Button" types), which can then be applied at different hierarchical levels that cascade to lower levels.

**[Select Application Theme](System%20Options/Themes.htm#selapptheme)** |  Used to apply an existing Theme at the **[General](System%20Options/Themes.htm#general)** level while designing your application in the NOMADS Panel Designer.  
**[Copy Theme](System%20Options/Copy%20Theme.md)** |  Used to copy the records for a selected Theme from the Theme Definition file in one directory to the Theme Definition file in a different directory. Provides the option to also copy Visual Class records related to the selected Theme. See **[How to Copy a Theme](../../How%20To/How%20to%20Copy%20Theme.md)**. _(The Copy Theme utility was added in PxPlus 2024.)_  
**[Maintain NOMADS Environment](../Maintain%20Nomads%20Environment.md)** |  Launches the **NOMADS Environment Maintenance** utility. This utility provides **_one central location_** to display and maintain **[%NOMADS Properties](../Appendix/NOMADS%20Variables/Overview.htm#properties_list)** used by the %NOMADS object (***obj/nomads.pvc**) to control the behavior of different aspects of the NOMADS environment. _(The NOMADS Environment Maintenance utility was added in PxPlus 2020.)_  
**[Change Directory](System%20Options/Change%20Directory.md)** |  Allows you to change your working directory for the current session.  
**[Application Parameter Configuration](Application%20Parameters.md)** |  Used by developers to define custom parameters specific to their applications and set their values.  
**[NOMADS Wiki Help](Nomads%20Wiki%20Help.md)** |  The _Wiki_ Help option in NOMADS generates Help documentation directly from a panel and displays it in the **[PxPlus Wiki](../../PxPlus%20Wiki/PxPlus%20Wiki.md)**.
