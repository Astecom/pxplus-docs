# Error Handling and Debugging

**HTML-Based Error Reporting**|   
---|---  
  
To view detailed information about a reported error, PxPlus provides an HTML-based "dump" panel for **[NOMADS](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/NOMADS%20Development/Getting%20Started.md)** and **[iNomads](../../../iNOMADS/iNOMADS%20Introduction.md)**. The information displayed in the "dump" panel includes:

  * Error status
  * Error information
  * Offending statement
  * Program stack
  * Directory information
  * NOMADS information (i.e. panel, library, folder, control name)
  * Variable information for call stack and control objects (i.e. global variables, NOMADS object information, open file channel information, etc.)



To invoke this "dump" panel, respond _Yes_ to the option to view a "dump" whenever an error message is displayed.

_(HTML-based error reporting for NOMADS and iNomads was added in PxPlus 2019.)_
