# Setup and Installation

**Custom System Configuration**|   
---|---  
  
In addition to specifying iNomads system parameters using **[Configuration Maintenance](System%20Configuration.md)**, you can further customize the general layout of iNomads templates by defining your own parameters in a _custom.conf_ file stored in the _*plus\inomads_ directory. When creating this file, it is important to follow the same formatting rules as the _custom.conf_ file located in the _templates/custom_ sub-directory within the _*plus/inomads_ directory.

Once this file has been created and detected by iNomads, you can maintain these settings by clicking the _Custom_ button (within the _System Settings_ frame box) on the **[iNomads Setup](iNomads%20Setup.md)** window.

This is invoked by using one of the following methods:

**Location** |  **Method**

From a Web browser |  Launch iNomads from a Web browser. From the **[iNomads Application Launchpad](iNOMADS%20Application%20Launchpad.md)** window, invoke the **[iNomads Setup](iNomads%20Setup.md)** window by either clicking the _Admin_ button or selecting _admin_ from the _Transaction_ drop box.
