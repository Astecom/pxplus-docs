The troubleshooting procedures in this section are intended to help you quickly identify and resolve problems involving the installation, start-up and configuration of PxPlus.

The **[System Analysis](../../utilities/system_analysis.md)** utility is a useful tool for analyzing the PxPlus installation and setup. It runs a series of tests and then displays the results, reporting any issues found. This utility is invoked either from the IDE Main Launcher or from the Command line.

_(The System Analysis utility was added in PxPlus 2022.)_
