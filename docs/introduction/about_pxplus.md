**About PxPlus** |   
---|---  
  
PxPlus is primarily designed for use in business applications, as it is oriented towards integer math and values with two decimal points (monetary values). The language includes a file/database handler that provides access for single and multi-keyed files, file and record locking, and an easy-to-use interface for terminal and printer output. Along with the processing capabilities of the language, the environment provides facilities for function key control, automatic error detection and correction, and program security. 

PxPlus is a completely portable environment. Versions of PxPlus are available for most major operating systems and hardware platforms. PxPlus programs and data files are completely transportable from one system to another without major modifications.

PxPlus is continuously evolving to meet the ever-changing needs of application developers and end users. Check out the PxPlus **[Release Notes](../Release%20Notes%20Introduction.md)** to stay informed and keep up-to-date on any new features, enhancements and changes included with PxPlus releases.
