PxPlus Views offer a more intuitive way to look at data and how it interrelates. They give developers the ability to define logical representations of data sources that are relevant and more accessible to the end user:

  * Provide only the data items you need to see.
  * Assign names that are more meaningful to data items.
  * Create virtual fields from existing data.
  * Combine elements from different sources.



The **[PxPlus Views System](../../../Views%20System/Introduction.md)** provides a simplified interface that allows you to create a hierarchical view of the related tables and fields that is much easier for the end user to understand. It includes built-in filters that let you define a dataset to retrieve just the records you need and to organize the data into meaningful groups.

Views can be accessed through the **[View Object](../../../Views%20System/Accessing%20View%20Data/Overview.htm#viewobject)**, the **[PxPlus Report Writer](../../../Report%20Writer/Introduction.md)** and the **[PxPlus SQL ODBC Driver](../../../odbc/pxplus_odbc.md)**. Use of this product may require a separately purchased activation key apart from your initial PxPlus activation.
