# Data Types, Literals and Variables

**Literals** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Literals are numeric, string or hexadecimal values that are written directly into the program code - they cannot be modified at run time. While variables are meant to be changed during processing, literal values remain **_Read Only_**. Literals are commonly used to display messages, assign constants, or place initial values into variables.

Two formats are supported for the definition of numeric literals in PxPlus: **_simple numbers_** (signed, with/without decimal point) or **_floating point_ _numbers_** (using scientific notation).

String literals consist of a series of ASCII characters contained within**""**_quotation marks_.
