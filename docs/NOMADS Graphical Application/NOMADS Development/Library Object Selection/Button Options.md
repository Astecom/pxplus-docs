# Library Object Selection

**Button Options**|   
---|---  
  
The button options in **Library Object Selection** provide convenient access to many of the functions that are also available as **[Menu Options](Menu%20Options.md)**. These button options are listed below.

####  **Note****:**  
The _name_ of some button options varies slightly depending on whether _Toolbar View_ or _Button View_ (see **[Views](Menu%20Options.htm#views)** menu) is selected; however, they invoke the same functionality.  
  
In _Menubar_ _View_ , the options listed below are available as **[Menu Options](Menu%20Options.md)**.  
  
For all **[View](Menu%20Options.htm#views)** displays (_Button View, Toolbar View_ or _Menubar_ _View_), right clicking in the Objects list box displays a popup menu with the following selections: **[Open](Button%20Options.htm#Mark1)**, **[Copy](Menu%20Options.htm#options)**, **[Delete](Menu%20Options.htm#options)**, **[Test](Menu%20Options.htm#options)**, **[Customize Panel](Menu%20Options.htm#utilities)**, **[Add to Project](Menu%20Options.htm#projects)** and **[Refresh](Menu%20Options.htm#options)**. Some of these are also available as button options.  
  
_(The Refresh option was added in PxPlus 2019.)  
(The Open option on the right click menu was added in PxPlus 2021 Update 1.)_
