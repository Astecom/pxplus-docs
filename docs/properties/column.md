# Control Object Properties

**Column** |  **_Column Number of Grid, List View or Report View_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Currently referenced column number of grid, list view or report view

This property does **_not_** contain the current column number of the control, but rather the column number being referenced when used in conjunction with other properties.

For instance, in a grid, setting 'Column to 2 and 'Row to 3 will allow the application to reference the 'Text$ value for the cell in column 2, row 3. It will not change the current position within the grid.
