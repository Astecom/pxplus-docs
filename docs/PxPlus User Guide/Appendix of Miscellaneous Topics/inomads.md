# Introduction to Using PxPlus

iNomads provides a Web-based environment that allows NOMADS screens and panels to be run over the Web from any industry standard Web browser. No download or install is required by the end user. Standard browser functionality (HTML and JavaScript) is used to render and process the panels.

iNomads takes your NOMADS panels and converts them to Dynamic HTML (DHTML) and, along with the associated JavaScript, provides an AJAX based interface to your application. iNomads itself is not a Web server but rather uses a Web server as the go-between for your application and the end-user browser. iNomads works currently with either the PxPlus Web Server or the industry standard Apache HTTP Server.

From the users' perspective, they will see the same basic panel and control layout as they would normally see when running a NOMADS panel except that the panels are running within a browser as opposed to running within an application such as WindX.

While NOMADS is used to control the actual layout of the panel controls, the appearance of your application panels (i.e. font, colors, size, images, etc.) within the browser can be tailored using iNomads.

See **[iNomads](../../iNOMADS/iNOMADS%20Introduction.md)** for complete information on how iNomads can be used to customize and run your NOMADS-based applications.
