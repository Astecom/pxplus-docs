---|---  
  
This section provides information pertaining to the tools and procedures used to convert from BBx to PxPlus. The toolkit described herein is located in the _*conv.bbx_ directory and consists of a number of programs that convert the programs and data files.

#### **Note:**  
The _*conv.bbx_ directory will be found in the _lib_ directory when PxPlus was installed, and as with all system utilities, the system will replace the _asterisks_ ( ***** ) with _underscores_ ( **_** ). For the purposes of this documentation, it is assumed that PxPlus has been installed in _/pxplus_ , thus _*conv.bbx_ will be in _/pxplus/lib/_conv.bbx_.
