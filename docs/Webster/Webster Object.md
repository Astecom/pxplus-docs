When running a Webster+ based application, many functions and properties are provided by the Webster+ object. This object (***obj/webster**) is automatically created by the Apache and EZWeb interfaces during the initial processing of all browser requests.

The object provides methods to update the screen, send messages, force events, along with hide, show, enable and disable controls on a Webster+ page. It also contains a link to the Webster+ bind object (***obj/webbind**) that is used to dynamically create HTML pages.
