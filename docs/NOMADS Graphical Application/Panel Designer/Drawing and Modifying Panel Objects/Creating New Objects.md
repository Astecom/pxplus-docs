# Drawing and Modifying Panel Objects 

**Creating New Objects** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Create a new object by selecting the appropriate tool from the **[Controls Toolbar](Controls%20Toolbox.md)**; e.g. the Button tool creates a button control. Position the mouse somewhere on the panel, then hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to create a rectangle to the desired size. Release the mouse button to create the new object in your panel.

NOMADS applies a default name for a newly created control in the format _controltype_ __#_ ; e.g. BUTTON_1.

See **[Creating Panel Controls](../../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Introduction.md)** for information on the different types of objects that can be added to a panel.
