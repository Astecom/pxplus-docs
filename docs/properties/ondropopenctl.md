## Description

CTL event to fire when drop box opened

This property controls the CTL event that will be fired when the drop list of a DROP box (normal or variable) is opened/displayed. If the value of this property is non-zero, the system will use its value of a CTL event to fire. Setting this to zero **_(Default)_** disables the CTL event from being sent.

_(The OnDropOpenCtl property was added in PxPlus v7.10, build 9171.1.)_
