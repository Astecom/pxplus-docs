# Control Object Properties

---|---  
  
## Description

Current column number with focus

This property contains the same information as **['CurrentColumn](currentcolumn.md)**; however, regardless of whether referenced as a string or numeric property, only the column number is reflected. (The 'CurrentColumn property reflects the column name when referenced as a string).

It is recommended that this property be used when accessing the control using **[Pseudo Properties](../control_object_properties/psuedo_multi.md)**.

_(The CurrentColno property was added in PxPlus v7.10.)_
