# Views Definition Object

**Subordinate Objects** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Subordinates to the main **[ViewCtl](ViewCtl.md)** object include **[ViewDef](ViewDef.md)**, **[CalcItem](CalcItem.md)**, **[ViewItem](ViewItem.md)**, **[DataGroup](DataGroup.md)**, **[DataSource](DataSource.md)**, **[DS_Item](DS_Item.md)** and **[DS_Link](DS_Link.md)**.

When the same method appears at the subordinate level, use the **ViewCtl** equivalent instead. **ViewCtl** methods include additional logic to deal with interrelationships between objects.

Subordinate object methods must be used where there is no **ViewCtl** equivalent. Some descriptions include references to **ViewCtl** methods that should be used in place of subordinate object methods.
