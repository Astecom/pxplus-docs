# PxPlus Releases

**PxPlus 2025 (version 22.00)** |  **_May 2025_**  
---|---  
  
**PxPlus 2025 includes new features for added security and introduces feature-rich enhancements to bring enhanced performance and flexibility to your applications:**

|  Keeping up-to-date with the latest security protocols is crucial for protecting sensitive data and systems from evolving cyber threats. Outdated security measures can leave vulnerabilities that are easily exploited. PxPlus 2025 features the latest security modules, safeguarding your application and your customers' data.  
---|---  
|  Email providers have strengthened email security by replacing basic authentication with OAuth2 to reduce credential theft and unauthorized access. PxPlus 2025 now supports OAuth2 authorization in SMTP and Web Email utilities.  
|  .NET offers a wealth of robust libraries. The new .NET Interface for PxPlus 2025 redefines what is possible with PxPlus, forging a powerful bridge to the .NET ecosystem and paving the way for the next generation of intelligent, adaptive applications.  
|  JSON is a widely adopted standard for representing structured data and facilitating data interchange across systems. The new JSON object in PxPlus 2025 is extremely fast and introduces a richer set of features and methods, greatly simplifying the creation and manipulation of JSON data while significantly improving current JSON functionality.
