**SQL Interface Objects** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
PxPlus also includes a set of OOP objects that are designed for accessing and updating external SQL databases in much the same way as PxPlus **[Data Dictionary Objects](../Data%20Dictionary%20Objects/Overview.md)**.

The following support external database interfaces in PxPlus:

|  **db_ado** |  Interface for connecting to a Microsoft SQL-Server database.  
---|---|---  
|  **db_db2** |  Interface for connecting to an IBM DB2 database.  
|  **db_oci** |  Interface for connecting to an Oracle database.  
|  **db_odb** |  Interface for generic open database connectivity.  
|  **db_mysql** |  Interface for connecting to a MYSQL database.  
  
Some of these objects replace older versions (see **[Legacy SQL Objects](Legacy%20SQL%20Objects.md)**).
