## Description

Control color of locked cells

This property applies to the **_entire_** grid and controls the color of locked cells.

When set to 1 **_(Default)_** , locked cells are shown with a gray background. Setting this property to 0 (zero) does not change the color of locked cells. This allows background colors to be set on alternating lines in a grid (see **[BackHilight1$](backhilight1_.md)** and **[BackHilight2$](backhilight2_.md)**), regardless if cells are locked.

_(The ShowLocked property was added in PxPlus 2019.)_
