***QUERY** |  **_On-Line Query Processor_**  
---|---  
  
The ***QUERY** utility is the 'standard' query processor. It uses the information created by '***QUERY.DEF** ' to create and display a query. See **[*QUERY.DEF](../Query%20Definition%20and%20Maintenance%20Program/Overview.md)** for details on query definition.

When a query is invoked, a window is displayed in the center of the screen with the first 10 records of the specified query file. The Up/Down arrow, Page Up/Page Down, Home or End keys allow for movement within the file. Optionally, full or partial keys may be entered to position directly within the file.

If the user selects one of the entries displayed, its associated values (defined by the query definition) are placed into the input buffer to be processed by the mainline program. This routine is mouse sensitive and provides scroll bars for direct positional manipulation.

#### **Note:**  
This sub-program supports the mouse.
