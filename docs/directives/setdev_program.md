##  Description

The **SETDEV PROGRAM** directive allows an embedded I/O program to be attached to an open channel or object if the file does not already have one associated with it. The embedded I/O program will remain in effect only until the channel is closed.

_(The ability to attach an object to the SETDEV PROGRAM directive was added in PxPlus 2016 Update 0003.)_

##  Example
