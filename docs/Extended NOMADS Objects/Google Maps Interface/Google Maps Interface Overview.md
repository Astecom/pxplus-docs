A Google Maps interface using Google Maps API v3 is one of the extended controls available in PxPlus. Google Maps is a Web mapping service application and technology provided by Google Inc.

#### **Note:**  
Access to the Internet is a requirement to use the service.

The PxPlus **[Google Maps Extended Control](Using%20the%20Google%20Maps%20Extended%20Control.md)** offers access to a wide range of features available in the Google Maps API, including map-related properties, methods and events, marker and info window processing, as well as geocoder functions and directions requests. A built-in link on all maps also gives the user access to the Google Maps Web page and additional functionality.
