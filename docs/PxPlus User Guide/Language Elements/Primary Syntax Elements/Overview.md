# Language Elements

**Primary Syntax Elements** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The PxPlus language uses a standard set of keywords and symbols to deliver instructions in a statement, as well as to create/execute programs. Some of these are required to make statements executable, while others are used to further define the tasks and the data in the operation being performed. 

#### **Note:**  
PxPlus keywords are reserved for internal use by the system - they should **_never_** be used as variable names in applications.

The primary elements in the PxPlus language are grouped as follows:

**Element** |  **Description**  
---|---  
**[Directives](Directives.md)** |  Commands that tell the system what task is to be performed.  
**[System Functions](System%20Functions.md)** |  Numeric or string operations that process values and yield results within a program statement.  
**[System Variables](System%20Variables.md)** |  Internally-defined numeric and string variables for providing system information, such as the date and time.  
**[Mnemonics](Mnemonics.md)** |  Special control sequences for output to a display device or printer.  
**[System Parameters](System%20Parameters.md)** |  Options for controlling a system's operation under PxPlus.  
**[Control Object Properties](Control%20Object%20Properties.md)** |  Named attributes for modifying graphical user interface control objects.
