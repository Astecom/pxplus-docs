**Change Directory** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The **New Current Directory** window is used to change the working directory for the current session. NOMADS uses this setting to locate its files during processing.

To invoke this window, select _Options_ > _Change Directory_ from the **[NOMADS Session Manager](../../NOMADS%20Development/Getting%20Started.htm#sessionmgr) **menu bar.

> Select a directory from the list box or click the Query button in the _Directory_ field to browse to a different directory or create a new one.

_(The Query button was added in PxPlus 2025.)_

You can also enter a path name in the _Directory_ field. If the path name does not exist, NOMADS displays a message and asks if you wish to create it.
