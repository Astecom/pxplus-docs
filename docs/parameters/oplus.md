# System Parameters

**'O+'** |  **_Change State of Modal Dialog_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

This system parameter is used to allow the state of a modal dialog to be changed when its child is active.

When the 'O+' parameter is **_not_** set, the state of the modal dialog cannot be changed when its child is active, which is consistent with standard Windows behavior.

## Default

**_Off_**
