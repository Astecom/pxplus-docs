## Do I need to get a separate Client ID and Client Secret for each Google Workspace object?

No. Once you have obtained a Client ID and Client Secret, the same ones are used for each Google Workspace object.

## Do I have to set up all three APIs/scopes if I want to use only one of the Google Workspace objects?

No; however, Google Drive API/scope is required whether you will be using only the Google Docs or the Google Sheets object. The Google Docs and Google Sheets objects use the Google Drive API/scope to handle the files.

If you will be using only the Google Drive object, you can enable only the Google Drive API/scope. See **Step 3** in **[Allow Access to Google APIs](App%20Setup.htm#allow_access)**.

##  How do I save a Docs document or a Sheets spreadsheet?

Google saves the documents and spreadsheets **_automatically_** as soon as changes are made.

##  How can I undo recent changes made to a Docs document or a Sheets spreadsheet?

When a document or spreadsheet is opened, the text "Last edit was _xx_ days ago" displays beside the _Menu_ tab. Click on this text to display a list of recent changes that were made.

##  Can I have multiple files/folders with the same name?

Yes. Each file/folder is assigned a unique ID, which allows multiple files/folders to have the same name.
