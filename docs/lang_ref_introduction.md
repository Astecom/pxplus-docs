**Language Reference**|   
---|---  
  
The **PxPlus Language Reference** is a comprehensive guide to all the features of the PxPlus programming language that includes **[Directives](directives.md)**, **[System Functions](functions.md)**, **[System Variables](variables.md)**, **[Mnemonics](mnemonics.md)**, **[System Parameters](parameters.md)**, **[Control Object Properties](control_object_properties.md)**, **[Specialty Files](file_handling.md)**, **[Reserved Words](appendix/reserved_words.md)** and much more.

This guide covers the various aspects of the language in precise detail, and as a result, its use is intended primarily for application developers. It does not attempt to explain how to design and implement an application as a whole.

For product licensing and installation, refer to **[PxPlus Installation and Configuration](PxPlus%20Installation%20and%20Configuration/Introduction.md)** in the PxPlus Help documentation.

For an in-depth look at the PxPlus environment, its uses and the details required to develop applications, refer to **[Introduction to Using PxPlus](PxPlus%20User%20Guide/Introduction.md)**.

For complete information on the graphical application development toolset installed with the Windows version of PxPlus, refer to **[NOMADS Graphical Application](NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Introduction.md)**.

Other PxPlus products, such as **[WindX](windx.md)**, **[PxPlus SQL ODBC Driver](odbc/pxplus_odbc.md)**, **[EZWeb Server](EZWebServer/EZweb%20Introduction.md)** (just to name a few), are presented as separate documents within the PxPlus Help documentation. References to these documents are supplied where applicable.
