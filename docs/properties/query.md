## Description

Assign a query to a grid cell

The expression should include the query definition name and library in the following format: "_QueryName,Library_ ".

When defined, the grid cell will display a lookup button with a bitmap, if a bitmap has been set; otherwise, the lookup button will display a **?** (_question_ _mark_) by default.

The Query property can also be set in **[Grid Presets Definition](../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Grid%20Control/Presets%20Definition.htm#queries)** when using the NOMADS Panel Designer.
