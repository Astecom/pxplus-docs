# NOMADS Development

**Library Object Selection** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
**_Libraries_** and **_objects_** are central concepts in **[NOMADS](../Getting%20Started.md)** and **[Webster+](../../../Webster/Webster.md)** development. Libraries are Keyed data files used by PxPlus to store the various object definitions created in NOMADS. The object definitions contained within a library represent all the components that will be generated by ***winproc** , the **[NOMADS Engine](../Getting%20Started.htm#engine)**, to create your graphical interface.

This Help section explains what libraries and objects are, how they are created, and how they are accessed and maintained using **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)**.

You can also access library objects from the IDE Main Launcher. See **[Accessing Library Objects from IDE](../Library%20Objects_ide.md)**.

_(IDE tasks for accessing library objects were added in PxPlus 2023 Update 1.)_

You can keep all of your object definitions in one library or maintain multiple libraries (for the organization of larger applications). Even if you start by creating a single library, the NOMADS toolkit includes general maintenance utilities that allow object definitions to be transferred between libraries as needed. See **[Maintaining Library Objects](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Overview.md)**.
