# Control Object Properties

**Compound Properties** |   
---|---  
  
Initially, control object properties were introduced to provide dynamic access to the basic attributes of a control object in PxPlus. The original list of properties covered obvious features (Height, Font$, Text$) in graphical control objects; however, as this list continues to expand with each new release of PxPlus, so does the variety of features that can be defined via properties.

Many of the latest properties are designed to provide characteristics and behavior that go way beyond what can be defined by directives alone. Most attributes are defined using _individual_ properties; however, some extended functionality is contingent on sets of two or more (**_compound_**) properties and requires more complex manipulation.

The following links provide additional information that identifies and describes these properties:

**Help Topic** |  **Description**  
---|---  
**[Multiple Selection Properties](multipleselect.md)** |  Properties used to process multiple selections in Lists and Grids.  
**[Pseudo Multi-Properties](psuedo_multi.md)** |  A pseudo multi-property is a property whose name is made up of multiple "String" properties with each property name terminated by a period. It is used in instances where an application needs to read or update a number of properties at the same time.  
**[Multi-Property Access](multi_prop.md)** |  Properties that allow an application to set/get values for more than one property for a control in a single command.  
**[Drag and Drop Grid Properties](dragdropgrid.md)** |  Properties associated with drag and drop functionality in Grids.  
**[Grid Cell Access Properties](grid_cell.md)** |  Properties used to identify specific cells to access a variety of Grid properties.  
**[Load/Access by Row Grid Properties](grid_by_row.md)** |  Properties used to load and access a Grid by row.  
**[Load on Demand Properties](loadondemand.md)** |  Properties used to improve List Box load times.  
**[State Indicator Properties](stateind.md)** |  Properties used to create and process state indicators. State indicators are images that will appear in front of a Tree View List Box entry and can be used to indicate whether the item has been selected.
