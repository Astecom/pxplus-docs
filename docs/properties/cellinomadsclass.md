**CelliNomadsClass** |  **_Apply iNomads Class to Grid Cell_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Apply an iNomads class to a grid cell

The iNomads class contains class attribute references used when defining the control in the HTML code generated in iNomads. An iNomads class reference must start with an alpha character (A-Z or a-z), followed by any combination of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore or dash. Multiple references may be entered, separated by a space. For a list of pre-defined classes, see **[iNomads Classes](../iNOMADS/iNomads%20Classes.md)**.

#### **Note:**  
The CelliNomadsClass property can also be set in [**Grid Presets Definition**](../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Grid%20Control/Presets%20Definition.md) when using the NOMADS Panel Designer; however, it will _only_ be applicable when the panel is run in iNomads.

_(The CelliNomadsClass property was added in PxPlus 2018.)_
