# Control Object Properties

**AutoState** |  **_Control Automatic Toggling of States_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Controls the automatic toggling of states in a tree view

The toggling occurs whenever a user clicks on the state indicator in the tree view. The number of states that the system will toggle through is determined by the value set in this property or, if the property is set to 1, the number of bitmaps assigned to the tree view.

In addition, when the user toggles a state indicator while holding down the **Shift** key, all entries between the current entry and the last will be toggled to the new state of the current entry (in effect, allowing for group select/deselect).
