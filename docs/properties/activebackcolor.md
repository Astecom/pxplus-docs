**ActiveBackColor $ (or ActiveBackColour$)** |  **_Background Color When Button Pressed_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Background color when button is pressed

If the check box or radio button is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added, this property defines the background color when the button is pressed. Then, two colors can be specified for the check box or radio button by using the **/** (_slash_) as a separator (i.e. RGB:100 100 100/Light Blue).

If a standard check box or a standard radio button is drawn (with no bitmap added), this property defines the background color when the check box or radio button is set.

For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

_(Support for standard Check Boxes and standard Radio Buttons was added in PxPlus 2025.)_
