# System Parameters

**'47'** |  **_IF47 Emulation_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

The **'47'** parameter enables IF47 emulation for Thoroughbred conversions. This parameter should be enabled if the Thoroughbred application was running with the IF47 option in the IPLINPUT configuration file.

The IF47 option suppress the generation of Error 47s when processing IF expressions. This avoids errors being generated in applications that attempt to compare/test substrings in an **IF** directive where the substring is out-of-bounds.

Without using this option, all **IF** directives in a converted application that refer to substrings could cause unanticipated run-time errors. Using this option eliminates the need of manually checking each **IF** directive during the conversion process.

_(The '47' system parameter was added in PxPlus v7.00.)_

##  Default
