**Copying Field Definitions**|   
---|---  
  
It is often desirable to duplicate the format (Name, Length and Description) of adjacent fields. To do this, use the mouse to select the fields to copy from and the adjacent cells that you want to copy to, and then either press F2 to complete the copy or right click the mouse and choose the _Copy contents left - > right_ option from the popup menu.

When copying, the format is copied from left to right along the same row. If the last character(s) of the Name and Description columns are numeric, they will be automatically incremented for each cell. If the last columns of the Name or Description are not numeric, a sequence number will be applied automatically by the system.
