---|---  
  
## Description

Color(s) of button border when button is pressed

Two colors can be specified for buttons, check boxes, radio buttons and tristate boxes by using the **/**  _(slash)_ as a separator (i.e. RGB:100 100 100/Light Blue). For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

Border colors are applied only if a **[Border$](border_.md)** property is specified for the button.

#### **Note:**  
This property is effective on a check box or radio button only when it is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added.
