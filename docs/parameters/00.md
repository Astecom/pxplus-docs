# System Parameters

**'00'** |  **_Don't Display NULL Bytes_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

The **'00'** parameter is used to control the transmission of $00$ to terminal and/or window screen devices. Some devices ignore the transmission of $00$, whereas, by default, Windows screens consider $00$ to be a character for the purposes of display.

Setting this parameter forces the system to strip any $00$ bytes from a PRINT string.

_(The '00' system parameter was added in PxPlus v8.11, build 9182.9.)_

##  Default

**_Off_** \- which means NULL bytes will be sent.
