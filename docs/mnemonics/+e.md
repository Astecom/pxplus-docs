**Behaviour _or_ GUI Display**

##  Format

_Allow_**Enter** _=_**Tab** : **'+E'**  
  
_Disable_**Enter** _=_**Tab** : **'-E'**_(default state)_

##  Description

Use **'+E'** and **'-E'** to control the use of the **Enter** key as **Tab** in Multi-Lines. Normally, within a MULTI_LINE, the **Enter** key is used to signal input completion or to enter a new line on a MULTI_LINE control that accepts multiple lines.

Setting the **'+E'** mnemonic causes the **Enter** key to be considered a **Tab** key, which can be used to advance to the next input field. 

This mnemonic is often used to ease the transition of text mode applications, which historically used **Enter** to advance between fields to the Windows convention of using the **Tab** key.
