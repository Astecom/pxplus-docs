# Graphical User Interfaces

**NOMADS** |  **__**

The easiest (and fastest) method for creating a graphical user interface in PxPlus is to use **NOMADS** (Non-procedural Object Module Application Development System).

NOMADS is the graphical application development toolset that can be used in conjunction with PxPlus and other languages to create graphical user interface applications. It also includes the ability to separate data, logic and presentation text and images within the applications. A common data dictionary provides the ability to view and maintain data files without having to write any application code. NOMADS also allows for the integration of both NOMADS-designed applications with non-NOMADS designed applications.

**_Development Environment_**

The toolset side of NOMADS provides an integrated working environment for building and assembling object definitions for the panels, dialogues and windows to be used in your graphical user interface application. These definitions are stored in keyed data files called _libraries_ , which are accessed for editing via **[Library Object Selection](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/NOMADS%20Development/Library%20Object%20Selection/Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)**.

When you develop components in NOMADS, the bulk of the programming is handled for you. Instead of typing lines of code in PxPlus to define size, placement and functionality, you simply draw the objects using your mouse, and then select the desired attributes from associated dialogues and menus.

The **[NOMADS Panel Designer](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Panel%20Designer/Introduction.md)** is the main work area in NOMADS. It is used for designing panel layouts and defining control objects. See **[Creating Panel Controls](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Creating%20Panel%20Controls/Introduction.md)**.

At the heart of NOMADS is a powerful run-time engine, ***winproc** , the central controller that operates in PxPlus behind the scenes to process the information stored in library objects _,_ generate graphical user interface components and execute associated event-handling logic.

**_Design/Development Toolset_**

NOMADS includes a set of tools and utilities for building graphical components and defining how your graphical user interface will work with your application. See **[Design/Development Toolset](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/NOMADS%20Development/Getting%20Started.htm#toolset)**.
