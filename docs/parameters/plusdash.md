# System Parameters

**'+-'** |  **_Suppress Library Trace Output_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

When the '**+-'** parameter is set, the system will not trace any logic executed within any of the system libraries.

This option is designed to make it easier to trace application logic where calls to the system library function can add significant unwanted output to trace files.

_(The '+-' system parameter was added in PxPlus v8.30, build 9190.)_

##  Default

**_Off_**
