## Description

Background color for system-generated buttons in a grid, including Drop Box buttons and Query buttons. For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

This property will also be applied to cells with the **['Lock](lock.md)** property set to 1 only when creating a **["Button"](../directives/grid.htm#Mark8)** cell type, providing that the **[BackColor$](backcolor_.md)** property has not been set specifically for that cell.

_(The ButtonColor$ property was added in PxPlus 2020.)_
