**Viewing the Field Contents in Hex**|

Normally, any non-printable character in a field is replaced with a **.**  _(period)_ on the display. If desired, any column can be displayed in Hex, thus simplifying the display of binary information on the file.

To select a Hex display for a column, right click on the column and select the _Hex Display_ option from the popup menu. This will toggle the _Hex Display_ option for the column.

When the column is displayed in Hex, the data is surrounded by **$**  _(dollar signs)_ , and the ruler line for the column is double-spaced to preserve formatting.
