## Description

Background color when mouse is over the control

If the check box or radio button is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added, then two colors can be specified for the check box or radio button by using the **/** (_slash_) as a separator (i.e. RGB:100 100 100/Light Blue).

This property can also be used to define the background color when the mouse is over a report view row.

For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

_(Report View support was added in PxPlus 2018.)  
__(Support for standard Check Boxes and standard Radio Buttons, Drop Boxes, Variable Drop Boxes, Multi-lines and RTF Multi-lines was added in PxPlus 2025.)_
