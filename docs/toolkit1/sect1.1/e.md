**Projects Manager** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The Projects Manager assists developers in keeping track of the various tasks used in the development of business applications by grouping programs, libraries and screens into projects. See **[Working with Projects](../../PxPlus%20IDE/Introduction%20to%20PxPlus%20IDE.htm#projects)**.

The _Projects_ display allows the developer to open the item by double clicking on the item in the list. Clicking on a program loads the program into the **[Program Editor](../Using%20the%20Program%20Editor.md)**. Clicking on a NOMADS panel opens the panel in the **[NOMADS Panel Designer](../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Panel%20Designer/Introduction.md)** for editing. Clicking on a library (_NOMADS Object Library_ or _Program Library_) opens the library maintenance utility specific for the type of library selected. For an explanation of the library types, see **[Library Manager](f.md)**.

Tasks that can be added to projects include NOMADS library objects (i.e. windows, dialogs, popup menus, queries), programs, Report Writer reports, data files and data dictionary entries.

For information on adding tasks to projects, see **[Project Maintenance](../../Project%20Maintenance.md)** and **[Adding Tasks to Projects from Other Locations](../../PxPlus%20IDE/Adding%20Tasks%20to%20Projects%20from%20Other%20Locations.md)**.

#### **Note:**  
As of PxPlus 2014, _Workspaces_ has been renamed to _Projects_.
