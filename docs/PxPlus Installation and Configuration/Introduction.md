The PxPlus Installation and Configuration Guide describes the requirements and procedures for downloading, installing and configuring the PxPlus system for use under Windows and UNIX/Linux platforms. This information should be read by system administrators who are responsible for setting up and maintaining PxPlus, as well as by application developers who wish to incorporate the PxPlus system configuration into the design of their proprietary applications.

Starting with PxPlus 2019, the packages needed for most business applications are included in the **_Base_** bundle.

The **_Professional_** bundle is designed for Client-Server implementation using the WindX Plug-in.

The **_Web_** bundle is designed for Web implementation.
