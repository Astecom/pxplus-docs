PxPlus does not impose further hardware prerequisites beyond what is generally needed to run supported systems. Your PxPlus applications may necessitate specific resources to be run efficiently; however, the base system itself runs under a minimal configuration.

The PxPlus website, **[www.pvxplus.com](http://www.pvxplus.com/)**, maintains an up-to-date list of supported operating systems. Refer to the _Downloads_ link to see if a PxPlus installation is available for your specific Windows or UNIX/Linux system.
