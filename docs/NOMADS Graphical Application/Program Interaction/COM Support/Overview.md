The PxPlus **External Control Properties** dialogue allows you to integrate external components produced by third-party vendors into your MS Windows-based PxPlus application (e.g. progress bar, spreadsheet, browser, or calendar). This dialogue is used to obtain information about, as well as access to, the internal properties and methods of the external control being used.

Four types of external controls can be created: _Chromium Browser_ , _ActiveX Controls_ , _PVX Plus Controls_ , and _.NET Controls_. NOMADS uses the **External Control Properties** dialogue to include these external components in your panels. It supports method calls, properties, event handling, as well as Post-Create logic.

For information on creating external controls, see **[External Controls - *Browser, ActiveX (COM), PVX Plus, .NET](../../Creating%20Panel%20Controls/COM%20Control/COM%20Control.md)**.

_(The Chromium Browser Object was added in PxPlus 2017.)  
(Support for .NET controls was added in PxPlus 2025.)_
