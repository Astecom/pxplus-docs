# Programming Constructs

**Flow Control** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Several mechanisms can be used to control program flow to perform conditional or repetitive instructions or to improve structure and maintainability.

**[Statement References](Statement%20References.md)** are sometimes an essential component for these types of procedures.

The PxPlus **[Structured SAVE](../../Development%20Tools/Error%20Handling%20and%20Debugging/Structured%20SAVE.md)** feature can be used to verify the logical integrity of decision and loop structures automatically each time you save a modified program.

This section covers sequence control statements for _repetitive execution_ , _conditional execution_ and _sequence overrides_.
