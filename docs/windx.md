**WindX™ Thin-Client** |   
---|---  
  
PxPlus supports graphical Thin-Client functionality for WindX for Windows-based PC clients. With thin client technology in place, multiple concurrent users can access your PxPlus applications in separate protected sessions on a single remote server. This arrangement permits rapid development and deployment of your programs across your user base. It also allows you to introduce a new graphical user interface or terminal emulator to an otherwise character-based, platform-specific application.

**_About WindX_ ™**

WindX is an enhanced graphical terminal emulator that provides a "Thin-Client" interface to PxPlus that allow graphical applications to run while connected to a remote computer. It also includes facilities for local file access and local processing.

Built into WindX is an ANSI/WYSE50 terminal emulator that supports three modes of communication:

  * Standard serial (RS232) communication for use with direct or modem connections.
  * Telnet protocol running across a LAN normally used to connect to a UNIX or Linux server.
  * Direct TCP/IP client/server facility that allows WindX to connect to either a Windows or a UNIX/Linux host system.



WindX comes with a set of utility programs to handle functions such as file transfer, remote command processing, and task initiation.

**_Thin-Client Advantage_**

PxPlus' Thin-Client technologies provide the ability to create a true graphical application, which runs on either Windows or UNIX interchangeably. No special software on the host, apart from PxPlus, is required to run on the UNIX system. This minimizes the amount of system resources required to service a large application and/or user installation.

PxPlus applications can use WindX with minimal code changes. System calls and functions that require access to the graphics engine are routed to the client station automatically.

The complete Thin-Client functionality has been integrated directly into PxPlus to create a seamless environment in which to create and run applications. All graphical directives and functions invoked by the application are tokenized and sent to the Client PC for processing.
