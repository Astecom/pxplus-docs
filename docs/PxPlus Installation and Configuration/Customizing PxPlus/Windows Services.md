# Customizing PxPlus

**Windows Services** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Use the **[Install Windows Services](../../Install%20Windows%20Services.md)** interface (added in PxPlus 2016) to add and install one or more instances of the following types of Windows services: **[EZWeb Server](../../EZWebServer/EZweb%20Introduction.md)**, **[Simple Client Server](../../simplecs/clienthost.md)**, **[AutoChart Scheduler](../../Chart%20Image%20Utilities/Installing%20Chart%20Generator%20as%20a%20Windows%20Service/Overview.md)**, **[Inittab Emulation Server](../../utilities/winutl_service.md)** and **[PxPlus Web Server](../../Web%20Server%20Reference/Setting%20Up%20PxPlus%20Web%20Server/Introduction.md)**.

Once you select the type of service, you can define the settings for that service. Other options include installing/uninstalling a service, adding another service and removing a selected service. You can also view and print a detailed listing of all the types of services.
