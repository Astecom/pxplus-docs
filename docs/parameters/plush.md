# System Parameters

**'+H'** |  **_Host Side WindX Caching Control_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

The **'+H'** parameter controls the host side caching of WindX controls. When using WindX and this parameter is set, the system will attempt to cache numerous control properties on the server.

The properties that are cached are controlled by the "*plus/wdxcache" program and its **ADD SERVER PROPERTIES** directives.

#### **Note:**  
This feature is only enabled when running a Professional version.

_(The '+H' system parameter was added in PxPlus v6.30.)_

##  Default

**_Off_** (Can only be changed when running a Professional or Web license)
