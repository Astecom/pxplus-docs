Report definitions can be created via the **[Report Designer](Report%20Designer/Overview.md)** interface, which allows you to:

  * Define the source of the data. See **[Defining the Data](Defining%20the%20Data/Overview.md)**.
  * Design the layout. See **[Creating the Report Layout](Creating%20the%20Report%20Layout/Overview.md)**.
  * Define additional report options. See **[Report Options](Report%20Options/Overview.md)**.
  * Set the output destination for a report. See **[Setting the Report Destination](Setting%20the%20Report%20Destination/Overview.md)**.
  * Save the definition so it can be used to generate a report. See **[Saving the Report Definition](Saving%20the%20Report%20Definition/Overview.md)**.
  * Test the report. See **[Testing the Report](Testing%20the%20Report/Overview.md)**.
  * Generate the report. See **[Generating a Report](../Generating%20a%20Report/Introduction.md)**.



The **[Report Wizard](../Report%20Wizard/Introduction.md)** provides a quick and simple way to create a report that does not require any special formatting. The wizard guides you through a series of eight interactive steps that result in the creation of a new report definition. When you exit the wizard, the definition is loaded into the Report Designer where you can customize it and make final adjustments before saving it.
