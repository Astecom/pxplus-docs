While PxPlus activation is normally a straightforward process, some issues may arise because of missing files/directories, incorrect licensing, permission difficulties etc. Be aware that activations are verified during the PxPlus start_up, not by the activation utility itself.

The PxPlus version and serial number are displayed when starting a new session.
