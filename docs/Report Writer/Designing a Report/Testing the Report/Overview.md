# Designing a Report

When creating a report definition, you may wish to preview the output. You can output the report to the PxPlus Viewer by selecting _Print Preview_ from the Report Designer _File_ menu or by clicking the _Preview_ button on the Report Designer tool bar.

The Preview function generates the entire report for viewing; therefore, you may wish to apply some filtering logic at the design phase if the report is large and time-consuming.

You may also generate the report in any format (Printer, PDF, Clipboard, HTML, etc.) directly from the Report Designer tool bar, regardless of the defined output destination, by selecting the drop-down arrow next to the _Print_ button on the Report Designer tool bar.
