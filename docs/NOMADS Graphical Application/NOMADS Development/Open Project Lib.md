# Accessing Library Objects from IDE  
  
**Open Project Application Library**|   
---|---  
  
The _Open Project Application Library_ task on the **[IDE Main Launcher](../../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.md)** uses the **[Default Library](../../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.htm#defaultlib)** defined for the current project to open **[Library Object Selection](Library%20Object%20Selection/Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)**.

To select this task, expand the _Graphical Application Builder (NOMADS)_ category on the _Menu_ list.

If no default library was defined for the project, a message will display when selecting this task. In that case, to use the task, edit the project by defining a default library.

_(The Open Project Application Library task was added in PxPlus 2023 Update 1.)_
