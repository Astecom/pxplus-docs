# Grid Control 

**Validating Cells in the Grid** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
On Focus and On Change logic can be applied to the entire grid or each cell, row or column in the grid.

By default, the On Focus logic will only execute when the grid itself initially receives focus. To trigger the On Focus logic on each individual cell, the _Automatic (Signal All Changes)_ property (on the **[Attributes](Grid%20Properties.htm#attributes)** tab) must be selected.

This logic will be executed when you use the mouse to click on a new cell or use the arrow keys to move through the grid.
