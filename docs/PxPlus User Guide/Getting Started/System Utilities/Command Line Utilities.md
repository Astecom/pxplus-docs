# System Utilities

**Command Line Utilities** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The **_classic_** utilities sub-system comprises a set of system utilities that may be called directly from the Command line. These are all accessed using a leading *****_asterisk_ (e.g. the character-based editor is invoked by entering CALL "*E"). You can also access these utilities via the **F5** function key or by issuing a CALL "**", which displays a set of menu-driven commands at the top of the console:

**Selection:  
Calculator Files Phone Utilities Edit Quit**

This character-based menu can be navigated using cursor keys or by moving the mouse pointer (if available). Press Enter (or left click the mouse) to select one of the options. The Utilities option (*u) directs you to a subsequent menu of character-based utilities, grouped under the following major categories:

**System Utilities:
