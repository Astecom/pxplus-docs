# System Parameters

## Description

When the **'XP'** parameter is enabled ** _(On)_** , the system forces the look of List View headers to be consistent with Windows XP.

#### **Important Note:**  
Special consideration should be taken before applying this parameter, as the look of List View headers on Windows XP (no longer supported) is significantly different than on more recent versions of Windows.

_(The 'XP' system parameter was added in PxPlus 2016.)_

**_On_**
