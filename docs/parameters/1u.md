# System Parameters

**'1U'** |  **_Force Dedicated User Slot_**  
---|---  
  
##  Description

Forces PxPlus to use a dedicated user slot for the session. This removes the shared nature of PxPlus under Windows or WindX and affects FacetTerm sharing.

##  Default

**_Off_** \- PxPlus attempts to use shared user slots for the session. That is, the same terminal is considered a single user regardless of the number of invocations. **TCB(27)** returns the User Slot Number this session is using and determines whether it is dedicated, shared, or a background task.

#### **Note:**  
Once you set **'1U'_On_** , you cannot turn it **_Off_** unless the application terminates.
