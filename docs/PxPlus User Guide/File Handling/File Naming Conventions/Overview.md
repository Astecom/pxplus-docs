# File Handling

**File Naming Conventions** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Actually, PxPlus does not impose any naming rules for creating or accessing files. While some naming conventions (specific prefixes/suffixes) may be required by the OS or to interact with non-PxPlus applications, PxPlus developers do maintain full control over how their PxPlus-based files are named.

_There are two exceptions:_ **[NOMADS](../../Graphical%20User%20Interfaces/NOMADS/Overview.md)** defaults to an .EN extension (English) for naming library files, but this may be changed by the developer. A .PVC extension is used in **[Object-Oriented PxPlus](../../Object-Oriented%20PxPlus/Introduction.md)** to define and/or access a class definition.

See **[PxPlus Search Rules](../Prefix%20Processing/Overview.htm#searchrules)** for locating file names.
