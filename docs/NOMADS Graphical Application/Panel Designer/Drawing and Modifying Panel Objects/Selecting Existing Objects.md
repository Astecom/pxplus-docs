# Drawing and Modifying Panel Objects 

**Selecting Existing Objects** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
**_Specific objects_** can be selected for editing using the mouse pointer. Once an object is selected, a tooltip indicating the name of the object and its position/size co-ordinates is displayed. The object's name is also shown in the status bar at the bottom of the Panel Designer. Another method for selecting a specific object for editing is to use the **Object Name Dropbox** in the Panel Designer **[Tool Bar](../Work%20Area/Tool%20Bar.md)**. This method is particularly useful for accessing objects that may be hidden or difficult to select via the mouse pointer.

To select **_multiple objects_** , first select the Group Items tool in the **[Controls Toolbar](Controls%20Toolbox.md)**. Then, use the mouse pointer to click and drag a selection box around several objects on the panel. Release the mouse button and all the objects within the selection box are selected.

To move or resize a group of objects, see **[Moving/Resizing Multiple Components](Modifying%20Objects.htm#Moving_Multiple)**.

To justify or space a group of objects uniformly, see **[Alignment and Distribution of Multiple Objects](Modifying%20Objects.htm#Alignment_Multiple)**.
