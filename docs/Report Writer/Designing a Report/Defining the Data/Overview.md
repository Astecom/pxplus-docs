# Designing a Report

**Defining the Data** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The data being used in the report must be defined in terms of input source selection, sort sequence, and selection criteria (for filtering the data). Data may also be derived in the form of external parameter values supplied at run time. These are defined via the Report Designer's _Data_ menu.

The following links provide information on defining the data for a report:

**Help Topic** |  **Description**  
---|---  
**[Input Source](Input%20Source.md)** |  Source of the data to be displayed in the report.  
**[Related Data Sources](Related%20Data%20Sources.md)** |  Additional related data sources that may be available if a report requires data from multiple sources.  
**[Sort Sequence](Sort%20Sequence.md)** |  Sort order for the data.  
**[Calculated Fields](Calculated%20Fields.md)** |  Define calculated fields to include in the report.  
**[Parameters](Parameters.md)** |  Define report parameters.  
**[Data Filters](Data%20Filters.md)** |  Set up selection criteria to filter the data for the report.
