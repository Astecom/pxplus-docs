# Creating the Report Layout   
  
**Page Setup** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The _Page Setup_ option on the Report Designer _File_ menu is used to set up margins and paper size, define orientation for reports output to printer type destinations (i.e. Printer, PDF, Viewer) and set the _Scale to fit_ check box option if it is needed.

> _Default paper size_ uses the current default paper size of the printer.

_Default margins_ are one-half inch for the top and bottom, as well as for the left and right, with the report data centered horizontally. _Custom margins_ can be set for the top, bottom, left and right.

#### **Note:**  
Care should be taken to set margins that are wide enough to avoid the no-print zone that many printers impose at the edge of the page.

_Orientation_ options are _Portrait_ and _Landscape_.

The _Scale to fit_ option causes the column width, line height and font size to be adjusted either up or down so that the report will fit the page size. If margins are defined, they will be maintained. If margins are not defined, a one-half inch margin will be used as default. When selecting this option, be sure to select fonts that scale well.

#### **Note:**  
When scaling reports containing images, you should use one of the _Resize_ display options when defining the image. See **[Images](Selecting%20Report%20Elements.htm#images)**.  
  
If an image is defined using an _Original size_ display option, the image size will remain consistent; however, the new dimensions will affect how much of it is displayed.
