# Control Object Properties

**FocusBackColor $ (or FocusBackColour$)** |  **_Background Color When Control Has Focus_**  
---|---  
  
## Description

Background color when the control has focus

Two colors can be specified for buttons, check boxes, radio buttons and tristate boxes by using the **_/_**_(slash)_ as a separator (i.e. RGB:100 100 100/Light Blue). For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

#### **Note:**  
This property is effective on a check box or radio button only when it is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added.

_(List Box, List View, Multi-Line, Report View, Tree View, VarDrop Box and VarList Box support was added in PxPlus 2018.)_
