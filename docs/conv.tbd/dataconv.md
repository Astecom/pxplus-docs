# Toolkit for Conversion from Thoroughbred

**Stand-Alone Data File Conversion**|   
---|---  
  
Often when doing a conversion, you will want to convert your programs and files up front, make changes to the programs and then re-convert the data files just prior to going live. 

If, at any time after the conversion, you want to re-convert only your Thoroughbred data files, you can run **"*conv.tbd/convdata.tbd"**.

This program will prompt you for the following:

|  _Name of directory to convert_ |  Directory that contains the Thoroughbred data files  
---|---|---  
|  _Output directory_ |  Directory where the converted data files will be stored
