## Description

Scrollbar slider/thumb size

This property defines the size of the slider in terms of the total size of scrollbar.

**Example:** If the scrollbar represents 100 records and the application is displaying 10 records, the application could set the ThumbSize to 10, resulting in the system displaying a slider approximately 1/10th the size of the scrollbar.

If this property is not set **_(Default)_** , the standard slider size will be shown.

_(The ThumbSize property was added in PxPlus v10.10.)_
