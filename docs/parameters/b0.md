##  Description

#### **Warning!**  
If the application is run with**'B0'** set, ensure that it is set on **_both_** the UNIX host **_and_** the WindX PC. Otherwise, the wrong windows will be addressed.  
  
Set **'B0'** either by using **-B0** as an argument on the WindX PC's start_up command line or as a statement from the host; i.e. EXECUTE "[wdx]SET_PARAM 'B0'".

##  Default

**_Off_** \- The base number for level and window is 1.

#### **Note:**  
This setting affects the **HWN( )** function, which relies on the base window number.
