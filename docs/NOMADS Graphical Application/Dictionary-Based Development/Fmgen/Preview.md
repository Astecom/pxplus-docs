# Step 6: File Maintenance Field Layout

**Preview Mode**|   
---|---  
  
The _Preview_ button is enabled on **_all_** panels in the File Maintenance Generator after a _Table Name_ is entered or selected in **[Step 1: Definition](Object%20Definition.md)**. Once fields are placed in the _Layout Grid_ , use this button to display a preview of the layout of the NOMADS panel or HTML page. The controls will not actually function; however, tabbing through the fields and switching folder tabs (if included) will work.

Prior to completing the File Maintenance Generator, use the _Preview_ button to view results whenever needed; for example, after adjusting the field layout or when visiting previous steps to change settings.

Click the drop-down arrow on the _Preview_ button for more options:

_Preview NOMADS Panel_ |  **_(Available when_ [NOMADS Panel](Object%20Definition.htm#formtype) _check box is selected for Form Type)_** Displays a preview of the layout of the NOMADS panel; however, the controls will not actually function.  
---|---  
_Preview HTML Page_ |  **_(Available when_ [HTML Page](Object%20Definition.htm#formtype) _check box is selected for Form Type)_** Displays a preview of the layout of the HTML page; however, the controls will not actually function. If the _Webster Preview URL_ has not been defined, a message will display.  
_Webster Preview URL_ |  Launches a separate window for entering a valid URL, which is required to preview an HTML page created by the File Maintenance Generator. A Web server must be running and pointing to an installation of **[Webster+](../../../Webster/Webster.md)**. The URL should specify the server and the Port number, separated by a **:**  _(colon)_. **_Example:_** localhost:8088/ (indicates that the Web server is running on your local machine on Port 8088)  
  
_(The Preview button drop-down options were added in PxPlus 2021.)_
