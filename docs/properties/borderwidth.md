## Description

Define width of button border

Controls the width of the border (in pixels) for any button or button-style check box or radio button whose border style (see **[Border$](border_.md)** property) is other than the system default. This property can only contain a numeric integer.

#### **Note:**  
This property is effective on a check box or radio button only when it is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added.
