## Description

Column header tip for list view or report view

This property is used to control the tip to display below the column header in a list view or report view control. To set/reference the tip, you must first set the **['Column](column.md)** property for the list view or report view to identify the column you are referencing.

By default, if no column tip is defined, the standard list view or report view tip will be displayed.

_(The ColumnHdrTip$ property was added in PxPlus v10.)_
