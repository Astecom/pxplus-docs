PxPlus supports **_Extended Controls_** that allow you to access external features, such as the Google Maps API, in a NOMADS or **[iNomads](../iNOMADS/iNOMADS%20Introduction.md)** environment.

PxPlus Extended Controls are available through the NOMADS **[External Control Properties](../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Creating%20Panel%20Controls/COM%20Control/COM%20Control.htm#COMcontrol)** window in the **[NOMADS Panel Designer](../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/Panel%20Designer/Introduction.md)**. You can select from a list of PVX PxPlus Controls, in addition to the list of ActiveX Controls, by clicking the Query button associated with the _Ext. Control_ field. The remainder of the NOMADS definition and processing is identical to that of a COM control; however, unlike most other COM controls, extended controls are also supported by iNomads.

The extended controls supported by PxPlus are:

**[eSignature Capture](eSignature%20Capture/esignature%20capture.md)** |  The eSignature Capture extended control is used to draw and capture electronic signatures in online and desktop environments.  
---|---  
**[Google Maps Interface](Google%20Maps%20Interface/Google%20Maps%20Interface%20Overview.md)** |  The Google Maps interface extended control offers access to the Google Maps Web mapping service application and technology provided by Google Inc.  
**[TinyMCE HTML Editor](TinyMCE%20HTML%20Editor/TinyMCE%20HTML%20Editor%20Overview.md)** |  The TinyMCE HTML Editor extended control offers access to TinyMCE, a platform independent Web-based JavaScript HTML WYSIWYG Editor control released as Open Source under LGPL 2.1 by Tiny Technologies Inc. It provides an editing interface that resembles how the page will be displayed in a Web browser and does not require any HTML knowledge.
