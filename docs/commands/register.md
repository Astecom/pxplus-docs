**REGISTER**

## Description

Typing the **REGISTER** command will attempt to use the Internet to register your software and update the systems activation keys. It can be used following a software upgrade to obtain the new licensing information from the PVX Plus Technologies licensing servers.

This command is the equivalent of running/calling "*PLUS/REG/NET" or running the Online Registration on Windows from the menu bar or Start menu.

_(The REGISTER command was added in PxPlus v11.00.)_
