## Description

Show tree view text as bold

Numeric value indicating whether the text for the selected item in the tree view will be shown **Bold**. Setting this property to 1 causes the display to use bold text; zero (0) causes normal text to be used.

This property is used in conjunction with the [**'Item**](item.md) property, which defines the item whose bold state is to be referenced.

_(The Bold property was added in PxPlus v9.00, build 9200.)_
