**Maintaining Library Objects** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
Once object definitions have been created and saved in a library (by using the **[Panel Designer](../../Panel%20Designer/Introduction.md)**, the **[Query Subsystem](../../Dictionary-Based%20Development/Query%20Subsystem/Overview.md)** or the **[File Maintenance Generator](../../Dictionary-Based%20Development/Fmgen/Fmgen%20Introduction.md)**), several tools are available for maintaining them at the library level.

Below is a list of tools that can be accessed via **[Library Object Selection](../Library%20Object%20Selection/Overview.md)**. The **Compare** , **Search/Replace** and **Merge** utilities can also be launched directly as menu bar options in the **[NOMADS Session Manager](../Getting%20Started.htm#sessionmgr)**. This Help section assumes access to these tools via the Library Object Selection window.

#### **Warning!**  
No audit trail is available for operations involving the **Merge** , **Search/Replace** and **Import** utilities. If an audit trail is needed, run the **Compare** utility before starting.  
  
**_As a precaution, make sure that your backup files are updated before attempting any of the below library-level operations._**

**Name** |  **Description**  
---|---  
**[Library Compare Utility](Compare%20Utility.md)** |  Compare panels from within the same library or from two different libraries.  
**[Search/Replace Library Utility](Search%20and%20Replace%20Utility.md)** |  Search and edit a number of panels simultaneously at the library-level.  
**[Merge Panels Utility](Merge%20Utility.md)** |  Merge the contents of one library into another library.  
**[Export and Import Library Objects Utilities](Export%20and%20Import%20Utilities.md)** |  Convert object definitions to text files, which can then be used for updating and copying multiple objects.  
**[Copying Library Objects](Copying%20Library%20Objects.md)** |  Copy selected objects within the same library or to a different library.  
**[Print Panels Utility](Print%20Panels%20Utility.md)** |  Generate and print a report on the contents of a selected panel.  
**[Query Bulk Edit Utility](Query%20Bulk%20Edit.md)** |  Set header options for multiple query objects in a library.  
**[Library Defaults](Library%20Defaults.md)** |  Assign default attribute settings to be applied to all objects created within the current library.  
**[Visual Class Assignment](Visual%20Class%20Assignment.md)** |  Assign visual classes (preset display properties) to selected controls in a library and panel.  
**[Group Assignment](Group%20Assignment.md)** |  Assign selected controls to a group name for a selected library and panel. This action may be performed at the control level, the panel level, and at the library level.  
**[Library Bulk Edit and Search Utility](Library%20Bulk%20Edit.md)** |  Apply changes simultaneously to controls in multiple panels either in a single library or in multiple libraries within a specified directory to standardize the appearance of panel headers and panel controls over an entire library.
