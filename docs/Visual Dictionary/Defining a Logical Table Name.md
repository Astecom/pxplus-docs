**Defining a Logical Table Name**|   
---|---  
  
Each file must have a Logical Table Name. The Logical Table Name will be used to define the file to the database. A Logical Table Name must start with an alphabetic character (A - Z) and contain only alphabetic characters, numbers, or an underscore character. The maximum field length for a name is 40.

If you enter spaces in a field name, the system will automatically convert them to underscores.

If you enter an invalid name, the system will restore the name to the previous value.

Once the table definition is added to the System Dictionary, the file can be accessed using the Logical Table Name.
