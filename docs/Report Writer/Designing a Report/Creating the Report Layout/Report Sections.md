# Creating the Report Layout 

**Report Sections** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
By default, the report's layout is composed of the following four sections:

> |  **Page Header** |  Printed at the top of each page  
---|---|---  
|  **Detail Line** |  Printed once per record  
|  **Report Summary** |  Printed once at the end of the report  
|  **Page Footer** |  Printed at the bottom of each page  
  
The lines beneath each section heading are printed whenever the section is printed. If you do not wish to print anything for a particular section, simply remove the lines under it.
