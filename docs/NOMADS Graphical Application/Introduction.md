**_Welcome to NOMADS_** (**N** on-procedural **O** bject **M** odule **A** pplication **D** evelopment **S** ystem) -- the graphical application development toolset installed with the Windows version of PxPlus.

NOMADS provides application developers with a powerful and interactive environment that is well suited for the design and development of application screens. This documentation explains in detail all the features and capabilities available in NOMADS for the creation of graphical user interfaces in PxPlus. It does not attempt to explain how to design or create an application as a whole.

Refer to the **[PxPlus Language Reference](../lang_ref_introduction.md)** for detailed information on the features of the PxPlus programming language.

For an in-depth look at the PxPlus environment, its uses and the details required to develop applications, refer to **[Introduction to Using PxPlus](../PxPlus%20User%20Guide/Introduction.md)**.

Other PxPlus products (i.e. WindX, PxPlus SQL ODBC Driver, Web Server and Application Server) are presented as separate documents within the PxPlus Help documentation. Rather than reproduce existing material, references to these documents are supplied where applicable.
