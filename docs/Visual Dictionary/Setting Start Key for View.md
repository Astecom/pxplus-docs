By default, when viewing the contents of the data file, the system will start the view with the first record in the file. If desired, you can change the starting point by entering a key value from which to start the display. This is done by clicking on the left column where the keys are displayed and entering a starting key value when prompted or by selecting _File > Starting Key_ from the menu.

If you enter a starting key that results in no data to be displayed; the system will inform you that there is no data for the starting key entered and present you with the option to clear the starting key and reload the display.

#### **Note:**  
Changing the key to be used will cause the system to reset the starting key value displayed.
