**Using Control Handles** |  **__**

Normally, controls for the current window can be directly accessed using their control number; however, from time to time, you may want to access controls from other windows.

Pseudo controls provide this capability and provide direct access the controls regardless of which window is the current (top most) window.

All standard control properties are available when using Pseudo control handles.
