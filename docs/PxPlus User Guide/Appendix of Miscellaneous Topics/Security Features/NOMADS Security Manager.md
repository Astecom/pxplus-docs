# Security Features 

**NOMADS Security Manager** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The **[Security Manager](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/System%20Maintenance%20Tools/Security%20Manager/Overview.md)** system in NOMADS allows you to protect your graphical user interface based PxPlus applications from unauthorized access. Individual screen components can be set up to allow full access, view-only access, or no access for specific users. Each user's authorization level can be based on User ID and/or security classifications.

This system is maintained via the _Security_ drop-down menu in the **[NOMADS Session Manager](../../../NOMADS%20Graphical%20Application/NOMADS%20Development/Getting%20Started.htm#sessionmgr)** menu bar.

By default, if a NOMADS panel has no existing object classifications, there is no security and all users are granted full access. If you assign one or more security classifications, then only those users who are _registered_ will have access. NOMADS does not display the control to users who are not registered in an assigned classification.
