**How to Copy a Project**|   
---|---  
  
These steps show you how to copy an existing project to a new project.

1. |  Invoke the IDE Main Launcher. The IDE Main Launcher can switch between **_enhanced_** or **_standard_** view as desired by clicking the Switch to Enhanced/Standard button (_double arrow_) located beside the _Project_ button.  
---|---  
2. |  From the menu bar, select _Projects_ > _Copy Project_.  
3. |  The **Copy Project** dialog displays. The _Project_ field shows the name of the current project, which is _Default_ in this example.  
4. |  Click the _Project_ drop down arrow and select the project to be copied. For this example, the project that is being copied is called _Demo One_.  
5. |  In the _Name_ field, enter the name of the new project to copy to and then press the Tab key. For this example, the name of the project to copy to is _Demo Two_.  
6. |  The _Directory_ , _Title Bar Color_ and _Default Library_ fields are automatically populated with settings belonging to the project you selected to copy from in the _Project_ field. You can change any of these settings or leave them as is, depending on how you want to define the new project. The _Settings File_ field shows _demo_two.prj_ , which is derived from the new project _Name_. If desired, this can be changed. For this example: The  _Directory_ field is not being edited and will be left as is.  
The  _Settings File_ field is not being edited. Leave this setting as is.  
The  _Prefix File_ field, which is blank, is not being edited. Leave this as is.  
The two fields, _Title Bar Color_ and _Default Library_ , will be changed so that they relate to the new project.  
7. |  Change the _Title Bar Color_ by clicking the Color Selections (_paint palette_) button. The **Color Selections** window displays. Select Dark Green and then click _OK_. The _Title Bar Color_ field shows the selected color.  
8. |  Change the _Default Library_. For this example, an existing library (_Panels2.en_) will be entered. The pathname is _C:\PVX Plus Technologies\PxPlus 2024\Data\Panels2.en_. In the _Default Library_ field, enter the pathname or click the Query button. If a library file is entered that does not exist, an **Invalid Library File** message will display: If this happens, click _OK_. The **Copy Project** window redisplays. Enter a valid library file.  
9. |  The settings for the new project have been entered. Click _OK_ to perform the copy.  
10. |  The IDE Main Launcher relaunches and shows the following changes: The IDE title bar color is now Dark Green and shows the name of the new project (e.g. _Demo Two_).  
The  _Project_ drop box shows that the name of the new project that was created.  
11. |  To check that the _Default Library_ setting will open the correct library file, expand the _Graphical Application Builder (NOMADS)_ category on the IDE Launcher and then select _Open Project Application Library_.  
12. |  The **Library Object Selection** window opens this project's default library. Notice that the title bar is Dark Green. This provides a visual cue that you are currently working in the _Demo Two_ project.
