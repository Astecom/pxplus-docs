# Licensing and Activation Keys

**Proprietary Activations** |  **__**

Some development shops maintain their own key generation system to control user access to the software they sell with PxPlus. These applications are encoded with a special _owner code_ (issued by PVX Plus) that permits the generation of activation keys by the software developer. The PxPlus activation utility is used to process the proprietary activation keys, which are recorded as _secondary-level_ package activations.

However, the majority of PxPlus-built applications are sold without the need for secondary activations. Most development shops implement distribution controls within their applications; i.e., _password protection_.
