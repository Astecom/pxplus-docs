# Mnemonics

**'+V' & '-V'** |  **_Control Row Highlighting_**  
---|---  
  
**Behaviour _or_ GUI Display**

##  Format

_Full-line Highlight:_**'+V'**  
_  
First Column Highlight:_**'-V'**

##  Description

The terminal mnemonic **'+V'** turns on full-line highlighting. Then, the user can click on any column of a Listview (Report Style) list box to highlight a row. When you use **'-V'** , the user must click on the first column to highlight the list box row.

By printing either of these mnemonics, you can adjust the highlight style for your application without having to modify each occurrence of a Listview (Report Style) list box in your application.
