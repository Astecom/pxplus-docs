**UTF-8/Unicode and DBCS Support** |   
---|---  
  
PxPlus includes built in support for both UTF-8/UNICODE and DBCS character sets allowing for the internationalization of an application. Using these extended character sets your application can display and accept data in any character set.

From an application design perspective, the UTF-8 interface is more portable than DBCS as it incorporates UNICODE, which is the internationally recognized standard encoded for virtually all characters in use.
