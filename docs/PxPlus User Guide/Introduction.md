**Introduction to Using PxPlus** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
**_Welcome to PxPlus_** an exceptionally powerful, versatile and intuitive programming language for building sophisticated business applications applications that are ready to accommodate future technologies and a variety of host platforms. The language is a derivative of Pr _o_ videX, which itself was a dialect of Business Basic.

This introduction presents general information on the PxPlus system, its use and the basic concepts required to develop PxPlus applications. The fundamental building blocks that are necessary to create programs in PxPlus are also explained; however, it does not attempt to explain how to design or create applications as a whole. Other topics that are introduced include the primary PxPlus syntax elements such as directives, system functions, system variables, mnemonics and system parameters, as well as file naming, data storage/retrieval, graphical user interfaces, printing, object-oriented programming and much more.

Other PxPlus products, such as **[WindX](../windx.md)**, **[PxPlus SQL ODBC Driver](../odbc/pxplus_odbc.md)**, **[EZWeb Server](../EZWebServer/EZweb%20Introduction.md)** (just to name a few), are presented as separate documents within the PxPlus Help documentation. References to these documents are supplied where applicable.
