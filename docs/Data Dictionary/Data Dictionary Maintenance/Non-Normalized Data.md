If the Non-Normalized check box is selected on the **[Elements](Overview.htm#tabs)** tabbed folder, then you will be able to define the records in a non-normalized data file. To do this, select the _Define_ button to access the **Non-Normalized Record Definitions** dialogue.

#### **Note:**  
Support for this capability is provided only within the **[Data Dictionary Maintenance](Overview.md)** interface, not within PxPlus or NOMADS subsystems. This option is intended primarily for the creation of INI files and SQL database definitions when migrating applications.
