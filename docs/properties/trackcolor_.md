## Description

Cell tracking color

Header cells corresponding to a cell that currently has focus are switched to color set by this property as the user moves around the grid. This provides a visual cue to the user for which column and row they are on currently. Only header cells that use their default color will change to the tracking color.

For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.
