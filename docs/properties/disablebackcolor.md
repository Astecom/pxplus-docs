## Description

Background color when the control is disabled

If the check box or radio button is drawn as a button, which occurs when a bitmap is added, then two colors can be specified for the check box or radio button by using the **/**  _(slash)_ as a separator (i.e. RGB:100 100 100/Light Blue).

For information on valid color names and color specifications, see **[Color Properties](../control_object_properties/colour_properties.md)**.

_(List Box, List View, Multi-Line, Report View, Tree View, VarDrop Box and VarList Box support was added in PxPlus 2019.)  
(RTF Multi-Line support was added in PxPlus 2024.)  
(Support for standard Check Boxes and standard Radio Buttons was added in PxPlus 2025.)_
