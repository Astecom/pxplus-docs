**SSL/TLS** |  **_Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security_**  
---|---  
  
**SSL/TLS** (**S** ecure **S** ocket **L** ayer/**T** ransport **L** ayer **S** ecurity) is an industry-standard protocol for managing the security of message transmissions over the Internet. It is used by millions of Web applications around the world for the protection of online customer transactions. Using SS/TLSL protocol in a website instills confidence that the user can expect a secure link and that the source belongs to a valid, legitimate organization.

SSL/TLS encodes the data, rendering it unreadable to anyone who may try to intercept the transmission. When an SSL/TLS session is started, the server sends its public key to the client, which the client uses to send a randomly generated private key back to the server in order to establish a secret key "exchange" for that session.

For information on SSL/TLS certificates and how they can be used with PxPlus applications, see **[SSL/TLS Security Certificates](../../../ssl_tls_certificates.md)**.
