**RENAME CLASS Directive** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
**RENAME CLASS** _old_name$_**TO** _new_name_

The **RENAME CLASS** directive is used to alter the name of a previously defined class. This functionality allows the application designer to alter an existing object class easily, without having to change programs.

**_Example:_**

> RENAME CLASS "_xxx_ " TO "_yyy_ " would auto-load the new class name _yyy_ from the file _xxx.pvc_ (if the definition does not already exist).
