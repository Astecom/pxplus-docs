# Running Your Application

**iNomads Application Launchpad**|   
---|---  
  
When iNomads is started from a Web browser, the **iNomads Application Launchpad** displays to allow you to select the transaction, panel name or program, library and working directory of the NOMADS panel to run. To run a NOMADS-based program, leave the _Library_ field empty and then enter the name of the program to run in the _Panel/Program_ field.

> This window consists of the following:

_Transaction_ |  Click the drop-down list to select the transaction associated with the panel/program you want to run. This list consists of pre-configured system transactions, as well as transactions defined in iNomads **[Transaction Maintenance](Transaction%20Maintenance.md)**.  
---|---  
_Panel/Program_ |  Name of the program or the name of the NOMADS panel to run.  
_Library_ |  Name of the NOMADS panel library to use. Leave blank to enter the name of a NOMADS-based program to run in the _Panel/Program_ field.  
_Directory_ |  Directory from which the selected transaction will be run.  
_Template_ |  Name of the template to apply to the selected transaction.  
_Admin_ |  Launches the **iNomads System Administration Functions** window. This is similar to the **[iNomads Setup](iNomads%20Setup.md)** window that can be invoked from the **[PxPlus IDE Main Launcher](../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.md)** (under the _Web Deployment_ category).  
  
_(The Admin button was added in PxPlus 2016.)_  
_Run_ |  Runs the selected transaction, panel or NOMADS-based program.  
_Spawn_ |  Launches the selected transaction in another browser window.  
_Close_ |  Exits **iNomads Application Launchpad**.
