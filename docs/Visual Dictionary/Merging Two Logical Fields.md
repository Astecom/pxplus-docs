**Merging Two Logical Fields**|   
---|---  
  
You can merge two adjacent, logically split fields back together by positioning the mouse pointer on the second field (the one on the right) and clicking the right mouse button to select the _Merge xx with prior_ option from the popup menu. The second field merges with the field immediately preceding it and the resulting merged field will be forced to a String type with the Length equal to the _total_ of the two merged fields.

#### **Note:  
** Only fields that are both adjacent **_and_** logically split can be merged.
