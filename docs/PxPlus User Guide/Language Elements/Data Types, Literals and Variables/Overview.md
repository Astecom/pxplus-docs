**Data Types, Literals and Variables** |  **__**

All content to be manipulated and processed through a PxPlus program can be categorized within one of two primary data types: **[Numeric Values](Numeric%20Values.md)**, which are used in calculations (i.e. account balances, prices and quantities), and **[String Values](String%20Values.md)**, which usually involve text-based information (i.e. account names, addresses and product descriptions). Most data is processed in the form of **[Variables](Variables.md)**; however, when constant values are required, numeric or string **[Literals](Literals.md)** can be written directly into the program code.

#### **Note:**  
There may be size limits imposed by the PxPlus activation or the operating system on different types of string and numeric data. See **[System Limits](../../../appendix/system_limits.md)**.

For information on how source data is accepted into a program for processing or where resultant data is sent from a program for storage or display, see **[Basic Input and Output](../../Programming%20Constructs/Basic%20Input%20and%20Output/Overview.md)**.
