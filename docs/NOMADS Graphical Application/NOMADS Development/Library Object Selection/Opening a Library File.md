To create a **_new_** library or access the tools for maintaining an **_existing_** library, use one of the following methods to access a list of available tasks:

**Location** |  **Method**  
---|---  
From the **[PxPlus IDE Main Launcher](../../../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.md)** |  Expand the _Graphical Application Builder (NOMADS)_ category. For a description of the tasks to select, see **[Accessing from IDE Main Launcher](Opening%20a%20Library%20File.htm#fromide)**.  
From the **[NOMADS Session Manager](../Getting%20Started.htm#sessionmgr)** |  Select _Library_ from the menu bar. For a description of the tasks to select, see **[Accessing from NOMADS Session Manager](Opening%20a%20Library%20File.htm#fromnomads)**.  
  
#### **Note:**  
The **_functionality_** associated with each task is **_identical_** whether the task is accessed from the **IDE Main Launcher** or from the **NOMADS Session Manager**. Only the method used to access the task is different between these two environments.  
  
##  Accessing from IDE Main Launcher

When the _Graphical Application Builder (NOMADS)_ category is expanded, the following selections can be used to create or maintain a library:

_Create Application Library_ |  Launches the **Development Library** window for specifying the name and location for the _new_ library. Enter a new name in the _File name_ field. NOMADS defaults to a _.EN_ suffix _(English)_ for library files. The **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)** window opens for the new library entered.  
---|---  
_Open Application Library_ |  Launches the **Development Library** window for specifying the name and location of an _existing_ library. The **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)** window opens for the specified library.  
_Open Project Application Library_ |  **_(Applicable when project Default Library is defined)_** Opens the **[Default Library](../../../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.htm#defaultlib)** for the current project (if defined) in the **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)** window. See **[Open Project Application Library](../Open%20Project%20Lib.md)**. _(The Open Project Application Library task on the IDE was added in PxPlus 2023 Update 1.)_  
  
Expand the _Utilities_ sub-category to access the following selections:

_Search and Replace_ |  Launches the utility used for searching and/or changing a number of panels simultaneously. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing library. See **[Search/Replace Library Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Search%20and%20Replace%20Utility.md)**.  
---|---  
_Compare_ |  Launches the utility used for comparing NOMADS panels from the same library or from two different libraries. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing library. Once the panels have been compared, a report is generated to display any differences and unique elements found in the comparison. See **[Library Compare Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Compare%20Utility.md)**.  
_Merge_ |  Launches the utility used for merging the contents (panels) of one library into another. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing "input" library. See **[Merge Panels Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Merge%20Utility.md)**.  
_Query Bulk Edit_ |  Launches the utility used to set header properties simultaneously on multiple query objects. See **[Query Bulk Edit Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Query%20Bulk%20Edit.md)**.  
  
##  Accessing from NOMADS Session Manager

The _Library_ menu includes the following selections:

_New_ |  Launches the **Development Library** window for specifying the name and location for the _new_ library. Enter a new name in the _File name_ field. NOMADS defaults to a _.EN_ suffix _(English)_ for library files. The **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)** window opens for the new library entered.  
---|---  
_Open_ |  Launches the **Development Library** window for specifying the name and location of an _existing_ library. The **[Library Object Selection](Console%20and%20Object%20List.md)** window opens for the specified library.  
_Search/Replace_ |  Launches the utility used for searching and/or changing a number of panels simultaneously. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing library. See **[Search/Replace Library Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Search%20and%20Replace%20Utility.md)**.  
_Compare_ |  Launches the utility used for comparing NOMADS panels from the same library or from two different libraries. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing library. Once the panels have been compared, a report is generated to display any differences and unique elements found in the comparison. See **[Library Compare Utility](../Maintaining%20Library%20Objects/Compare%20Utility.md)**.  
_Merge_ |  Launches the utility used for merging the contents (panels) of one library into another. Prior to launching this utility, the **Development Library** window displays for specifying the name and location of an existing "input" library.

The bottom portion of the _Library_ drop-down menu provides a list of up to nine previously opened libraries. Select a listed file name for quick access to an existing library.
