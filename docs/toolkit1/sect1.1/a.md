# IT - Integrated Toolkitâ„¢

**Screen Layout** |  **__**  
---|---  
  
The main Integrated Toolkit screen provides three separate regions for program information, program editing/development and debugging information:

  * Program Synopsis display (left pane)
  * Program display and editing region (right pane)
  * Debug control panel (bottom pane)



The default display is the **[Program Synopsis](d.md)**, which allows you to navigate and manipulate the contents of a selected program. This display can be changed to **Projects** or **Normal** by selecting the drop box above the Synopsis display or using the _View_ menu. Selecting **[Projects](e.md)** displays a list of your projects. Selecting **Normal** suppresses the display of the left pane to provide more space for displaying and editing the program.

The **[Debug](b.md)** control panel displays only when a process is being debugged. While its normal position is across the bottom of the main Integrated Toolkit screen, you can easily switch it to display as a separate window that can be resized and moved independently.

> The size of these regions can be adjusted using the vertical and horizontal sizer bar controls (narrow bar between the panes). Position the mouse pointer on the sizer control until the mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, and then drag the mouse to adjust the size. The location of the sizer bar is saved between sessions.

Other interfaces within the Integrated Toolkit (such as the **[Library Manager](f.md)** utilities) have their own freestanding windows that can be placed anywhere and independently sized, allowing you to make use of available display space and multi-monitor systems.

A menu bar and a tool bar provide access to the more common functions. For an explanation of these functions, see **[Using the Program Editor](../Using%20the%20Program%20Editor.md)**.

Below the tool bar is a program bar that displays a tab for each opened program. Multiple programs can be opened at one time. Clicking on a program tab allows you to move easily among your opened programs. Positioning the mouse pointer over a program tab displays the full pathname of the opened program. An "X" has been added to the program tabs (as of PxPlus 2014) to make closing a program easier. All other functionality associated with these tabs remains the same.

A _Project_ menu has also been added to the menu bar with selections for _Create New Project_ and _Add to Project_ :

_Create New Project_ |  Launches the **[Create Project](../../PxPlus%20IDE/IDE%20Main%20Launcher.htm#createproject)** dialogue for entering a new project for the current working directory. Click the Query button to select a different working directory.  
---|---  
_Add to Project_ |  Launches the **Add to Project** dialogue for adding the current task to an existing project that is selected from the _Project_ drop box. To manage all the tasks within a project, see **[Project Maintenance](../../Project%20Maintenance.md)**. For information on adding tasks to a project from other locations, see **[Adding Tasks to Projects from Other Locations](../../PxPlus%20IDE/Adding%20Tasks%20to%20Projects%20from%20Other%20Locations.md)**.
