**System Variables** |   
---|---  
  
This section, when expanded, provides a list of all PxPlus system variables, arranged in alphabetical order. Each definition includes the correct syntax (showing associated parameters), values returned, a general description, examples, and cross references to related documentation where applicable.

Each variable is also identified as to whether it returns a _string_ or _numeric_ value.

#### **Important Note:**  
All system variables have reserved three-character names.  
  
To avoid potential conflicts with the reserved list and since PxPlus might include more three-character variables in future, it is best not to use three-character variable names in your applications.
