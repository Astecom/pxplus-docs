## Adding a New Field (Column)

To add a new logical field to the system, right click on any data column and select the _Add column to end of record_ option from the popup menu. This will create a new "dummy" field at the end (far right) of the dictionary. The default definition that is created will consist of a 25-character String field.

## Deleting the Last Field (Column)

To delete the _last column_ from the dictionary, right click on the last column and select the _Drop Field_ option from the popup menu.
